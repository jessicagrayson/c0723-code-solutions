## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do two div elements "vertically stack" on one another by default?: Because they are block level elements

- What is the default `flex-direction` of an element with `display: flex`?: Row

- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?): Columns, rows and content. We use helper classes such as "column-one-third" to signal how much of the row it should span, as well as allows us to easily style columns of the same size.

- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**? At least one column per row

- What is the purpose of a **container**?: To "hold" the rest of the layout which will be comprised of other elements, divs, rows, columns, etc.
