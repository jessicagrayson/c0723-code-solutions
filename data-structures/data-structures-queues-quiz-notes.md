## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does the acronym FIFO mean?: First in, first out. Indicating that the first thing added will also be the first thing to be removed.

- What methods are available on a Queue data structure?: dequeue (removes the front value from the queue and returns it) and enqueue(adds a value to back of the queue)

- What must you do to access the value at an arbitrary point in a queue (not just the "front")?: You need to iterate through the queue because queues naturally follow the FIFO order.
