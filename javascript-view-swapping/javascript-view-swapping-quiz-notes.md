## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?: The element that triggered the event.

- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?: It will not be visible on the page.

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?: It takes CSS selectors and will return true or false dependingon whether the element matches the chosen selectors.

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?: Using the getAttribute method.

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?: Throughout the entirety of writing the code as it allows you to quickly spot bugs or errors.

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?: Event listeners would have to be manually attached to each relevant element rather than relying on bubbling.

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?: You could directly add event listeners to each "tab", but that would be impractical and difficult to read/understand for others viewing your code.
