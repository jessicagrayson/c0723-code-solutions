- How do you declare a class?: By calling the Class keyword, using the constructor method to define parameters and using the this keyword to assign values to the parameters.

- Why would you want to inherit from another class?: If you want to use the same "template" for multiple objects and/or if you want to use some of the same properties but add/remove/change others.

- How do you add methods and properties to a class?: Using the this keyword.
