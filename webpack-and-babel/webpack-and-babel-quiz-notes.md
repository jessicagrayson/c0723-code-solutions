## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is Webpack?: A bundler that processes large amounts of code into a one or few files that can be downloaded and are more managable.

- What is the advantage of using Webpack (or a similar bundler)?: They "bundle" or "package" code into a very small number of files, removes unused code, and may "obscure" code so that it is difficult to understand - beneficial if you want to protect your code from "prying eyes".

- What is Babel?: It transpiles (or translates) modern versions of JS into older versions - this allows devs to write code with new JS features that can still run on older devices and systems.

- What is the advantage of using Babel (or a similar transpiler)?: It essentially makes JS backwards-compatible so that you can write JS with modern features and enhancements, but still be able to run that code on older devices that may not support these features.
