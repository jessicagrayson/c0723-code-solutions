## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?: Can be used to get or set the class name of a DOM element.

- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?: className property w/ assignment operator

- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?: Represents the text content of the node. Also a "getter setter".

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?: textContent property w/ assignment operator.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?: No, because we may not need to use it even though we always have it.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?: More complicated because we would have many more steps that would require that we continuously query the DOM to get and manipulate info.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?: Makes it easier to reuse that value without always needing to access the DOM.
