## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a React component?: A 'chunk' of JS logic with markup (JSX) and styles mixed in.

- How do you define a component in React?: By first exporting the component with 'export default', then defining the component as if it were a normal function with a capital first letter, then we add some JSX and then call it somewhere in the page to put it there.

- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?: See above, but basically we create the component as if it were a function elsewhere in the file and then when we want to, we call it.
