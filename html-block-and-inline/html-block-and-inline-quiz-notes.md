## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?: They always start on a new line and many browsers will automatically add some margin before and after the element, It always takes up the full width available. Examples are p and div.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?: They do not start on a new line and will only take up as much width as necessary. An example would be span.

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?: The width will fill the entire horizontal space of its parent container and it will be as "tall" as the height of its contents.

- What are the default width and height of an inline element?: They only take up as much space as they need based on their content.
