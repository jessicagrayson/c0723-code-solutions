## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?: A function essentially "packaged" code that can be reused throughout the program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.: Function keyword, function's name (optional), zero or more parameters, and then a code block enclosed in curly braces followed by an optional return statement.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.: The function name, parenthesis and any applicable arguments that would go inside of the paranthesis.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?: The function definition is where we are actually writing the function and telling the program what the function should do, but the code doesn't run until it is called. Calling the function is just instructing the computer to execute that code.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?: Parameters are used in defining the function, while arguments are utilized when calling the function

- Why are function **parameters** useful?: They act as a placeholder where we can later plug in a value that the function can be applied to.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?: It causes the function to produce a value that can be used in the program and it exists the function preventing any more code in the function's code block from running.
