## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a "callback" function?: A function that gets passed into another as an argument, it is then invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.

- Besides adding an event listener callback function to an element or the `document`, what is one way to delay the execution of a JavaScript function until some point in the future?: Using the setTimeout() global function with parameters including the function or code to run, along with the preferred delay in milliseconds, and then any parameters

- How can you set up a function to be called repeatedly without using a loop?: Using setInterval()

- What is the default time delay if you omit the `delay` parameter from `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`?: 0, so it will execute immediately or when the next relevant event occurs

- What do `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return?: A positive integer which identifies the timer created by the call to setTimeout()
