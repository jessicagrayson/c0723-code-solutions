## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is SQL and how is it different from languages like JavaScript?: Structured Query Language is a declarative programming language that is useful for retrieving, creating, and manipulating data in a relational database. They allow the programmer to describe their desired result so that the program can implement this to the best of its abilities.

- How do you retrieve specific columns from a database table?: By specifying them with the select keyword and the column name or names.

- How do you filter rows based on some specific criteria?: By using the "where" keyword which to specify which items we want. Such as example: where "category" = 'cleaning', so that we will only get the rows that have 'cleaning' as their "category".

- What are the benefits of formatting your SQL?: Formatting it makes it easier to read and keeps things organized.

- What are four comparison operators that can be used in a `where` clause?: =, <, >, !=

- How do you limit the number of rows returned in a result set?: By using the limit keyword to specify how many results we actually want.

- How do you retrieve all columns from a database table?: By pairing the select keyword with \* (idk why there is a slash there - it won't go away)

- How do you control the sort order of a result set?: By using the order by keyword.
