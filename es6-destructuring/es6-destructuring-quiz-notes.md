## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?: It is the process of assigning object properties or array values into distinct, independent varialbes

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?: Variable initializor (let, const) followed by curly braces and inside the curly braces you call the object property name and using a colon you assign it to a new variable.

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?: Variable initializor (let, const) followed by an array of variable names (ie [x, y, z]) with an = and the function whose return values we wish to assign the variables to.

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?: Creating object and array literals requires us to verbosely assign a variable to a series of object properties or array values by declaring variable first and then listing key/value pairs. When destructuring, that is not necessary - we can simply do this as described above.

If the brackets are on the left we are destructuring, if on the right we are creating
