After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are unit tests?: A means of testing small bits of code - the smaller the better.

- Why is it important to write unit tests?: Because they will help you locate and expose bugs before the code goes out into production.

- What code should be tested with a unit test? What code is not well suited for unit tests?: Smaller chunks of code, or specific areas of a code base. Code that crosses system borders, touches databases or 3rd party systems or involves end to end testing should probably be done using a framework or tool designed for this purpose.
